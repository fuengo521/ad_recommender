# Digital Distraction Analyzer

## Overview

**Digital Distraction Analyzer** is a data analytics project developed for the **ESI 4611: Advanced Data Analytics** course (Spring 2025) at the University of Florida. This project explores the behavioral patterns of social media users to uncover how excessive screen time affects productivity, satisfaction, and digital well-being. 

Using the **“Time-Wasters on Social Media”** synthetic dataset from Kaggle, we apply clustering, classification, regression, and tree-based models to uncover insights, predict user addiction levels, and provide strategic recommendations to reduce productivity loss.

## Problem Statement

Social media has become a major source of entertainment, procrastination, and even addiction. With so much time spent on digital platforms, individuals experience varying levels of productivity loss, satisfaction, and behavioral shifts. Understanding these patterns can help inform wellness strategies and potentially guide product development or digital wellness tools.

This project investigates:
- Behavioral traits linked to digital overuse and loss of self-control.
- Differences in social media engagement across demographics.
- Predictive factors that drive productivity loss or addiction.
- Strategies for mitigating negative impacts of excessive screen time.

## Objectives and Scope

### Objectives:
- Clean and preprocess the **Time-Wasters on Social Media** dataset.
- Apply clustering algorithms to group users by digital behavior patterns.
- Build classification and regression models to predict:
  - Productivity loss  
  - Addiction level  
  - Satisfaction and engagement scores
- Use tree-based models to analyze feature importance.
- Explore simple neural network models (stretch goal).
- Design a basic recommendation system to provide personalized digital wellness suggestions.

### Scope:
- Work with a synthetic dataset containing 1,000 diverse user profiles.
- Analyze variables including:
  - Demographics (age, gender, profession, income, location)
  - Platform usage (time spent, frequency, scroll rate, device type)
  - Psychological traits (self-control, addiction level, satisfaction)
  - Engagement context (watch time, current activity, watch reason)
- Test and compare multiple machine learning models.
- Produce visual insights, behavior profiles, and user recommendations.
