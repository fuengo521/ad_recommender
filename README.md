# Social Media Ad Recommender

## Overview

Social Media Ad Recommender is an advanced data analytics project designed for the ESI 4611: Advanced Data Analytics course (Spring 2025) at the University of Florida. This project aims to analyze user behavior from the Social Media and Entertainment Dataset (Kaggle) to understand how social media and entertainment consumption impact digital engagement, well-being, and advertisement interactions. By applying clustering techniques and predictive modeling, we seek to categorize users and build a recommendation system that forecasts advertisement interaction trends, thus enabling advertisers to target their campaigns more effectively.

## Problem Statement

Social media and entertainment consumption have a significant influence on usersâ€™ habits and overall well-being. Advertisers face challenges in effectively targeting their campaigns due to the complexity and variety of user behavior data. Our project addresses this challenge by:
- Analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing over 300,000 synthetic data points.
- Clustering algorithms used to segment users based on demographics and behavior.
- Developing a predictive model to forecast advertisement interaction trends for different user groups.

## Objectives and Scope

- **Objectives:**
  - Clean and preprocess the Social Media and Entertainment Dataset.
  - Apply clustering algorithms to categorize users by demographics and usage patterns.
  - Develop a predictive model to identify which user groups are most likely to interact with specific types of advertisements.
  - Design and implement a recommendation system for improved ad targeting.
  - **[Additional objectives to be added]**

- **Scope:**
  - Analyze synthetic data from the Kaggle Social Media and Entertainment Dataset.
  - Examine key metrics such as quality sleep, social well-being, physical activity, and tech savviness across different regions.
  - **[Further scope details to be defined]**

## Technology Stack [WIP]

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Processing and Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning & Clustering:** scikit-learn, [Other ML libraries if applicable]
